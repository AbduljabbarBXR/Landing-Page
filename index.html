                            <p class="hero-paragraph"><center>As the world evolves technologically, Programming languages will soon be a second mother tongue. being a computer programmer is that you can get to work in teams , apply your knowledge at home & have a positive job growth , The drawback in this business is that the work environment tend to be the same , high level of stress and need to be committed to the job and work long hours.</center> </p>

                        

                            <p><center>Give us this day our daily output. And forgive us our code duplication, as we forgive those who duplicate code against us. And lead us not into frustration; but deliver us from GOTOs. For thine is the algorithm, the computation, and the solution, looping forever and ever.</center></p>

                                    <p class="text-sm mb-0">I have alot of interests to be honest. Before i started my journey with computers, i was a professional athlete in both professional Boxing and 100 meters sprinting. Due to unprecedented career changing injuries during training, i was forced to quit and shift my goals.During physiotherapy sessions, I got into the field of bodybuilding and became a personal trainer and i still love to do this. Basically just lifting heavy stuff and putting them down.</p>
